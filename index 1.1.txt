*Graphic Deisgn and Animation
I enjoy using professional tools such as Adobe Illustrator to convey a complex or abstract concept and information by minimum and straightforward vector design. Also, I am an enthusiast at motion graphic by its vivid characters, smooth animation, and effective communication.
