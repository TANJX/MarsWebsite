Drawing table

## Material Project
### Wood - Serving Tray
2019/9/10

I travelled to the United Kingdom this March. I enjoyed the dinner my
friends and I had at a steak place. The chef put the steak on top of a
dark wooden serving tray. The entire restaurant was not bright and
well-lit, and all the chairs and tables were made of wood. This
configuration of the restaurant created a special atmosphere and
attached personality to the food and the restaurant. I would never
forget my experience there, and for this project, I wanted to create a
serving tray to add similar personality to the food I eat.

#### THE PROCESS
##### Day 1 – The Body
2019/10/13

To construct my own serving tray, I started to find materials in the
woodshop. I got 3 pieces of 1 by 4 pine wood from the scrap bin. Most
parts were in good condition. I measured and marked the width of my
serving tray; then, I used the miter saw to cut the wood into 4 pieces.
I wanted these 4 pieces glued right next to each other, so I used the
jointer to flatten both sides of the 4 pieces. Finally, I glued 4 pieces
together and clamped the whole piece.

##### Day 2 – The side bar

After the glue dried overnight, I tried to use the planner to flatten
the surface, but it was too big to fit the machine. Therefore, I used
orbit sander the flatten the different heights of 4 pieces of wood. I
used another 1 by 4 pine wood to cut two pieces of wood whose length
equals to the length of shorter side of the body part. Then I glued
these 2 pieces on the two sides of the body.

##### Day 3 – The Handle
The most difficult part of this project is to make the handle. I looked
up a few designs online and decided on curved handles at first. I used
miter saw to cut several short pieces of wood. I used pencil to sketch
the contour of the handle. Unfortunately,  when I tried to cut it using
band saws, I could not simply cut it with that angle.

After that, I tried to make rounded square handles instead. I used the
drill press with 1-inch bit to punch 2 holes on each handle piece as the
inner round edges. I used band saw to cut according to the two
perpendicular tangents for each circular hole. Then, I used pencil to
mark the outer rounded edge and used the disk sander to create the
rounded edges. Finally, I used the table router on all edges of the
handle to create a small profile of rounded edges. Lastly, I glued the
handle on the board.

##### Day 4 – Stain
I applied the dark walnut stain on all surfaces, except the bottom, of
my serving tray. I let it dry overnight. When the stain dried, I
realized I made a mistake. The stain would not remain on top of the wood
glue. I should have completely sanded off the glue exposed.

##### Day 5 – Mineral Oil
On Sunday, to make my serving tray food safe, I bought a food-safe
mineral oil online and applied it on the top surface.

The Serving Tray

#### Personality
I want my serving tray to have a naturally luxuriant, mature, and
upscale personality.

It is the wood material itself and the stain color I chose that produce
the personality of my serving tray. Just like the food put on the top of
the plate, the material of this wooden serving tray was sourced directly
from the nature and went through few human processes unlike polymer.

In addition, I particularly enjoyed using the stain to create a façade 
and completely change the overall appearance and feeling of a wooden
piece. I chose the walnut stain because of the dark color and the fact
that walnut is almost never used in construction but usually seen in
high-end furniture such as the Shakers’ design.

However, the personality I wanted to convey may not be obvious due to 
the way I applied the stain. I forgot to clean up the glue and wiped out
too much stain with paper tower so the stain layer is not average.

### Recyclable - Pixel Art of The Starry Night
2019/10/27

I enjoy pixel arts. Last semester, I made a 8-bit game in JavaScript
last semester and love the way pixelated representation of objects and
figures. Therefore, I decided to make a pixel art in which each pixel is
made of trash or recyclable material. Van Gogh’s Starry Night instantly
came to my mind. This artwork has a lot of blue colors, and,
fortunately, I have many packaging materials in my room that has
different shades of blue.

#### THE PROCESS
I started this project by contemplating this amazing artwork. I
realized that it is unexpectedly detailed and would be hard to translate
to a pixel art. Therefore, I looked for other people’s work. I found a
pixel art for Starry Night and used Photoshop to reduce the dimension to
48 pixels by 34 pixels and the number of colors to 7. It is 1632 pixels
in total. I then used python to count how many pixels for each color to
prepare.

Color Chart

I sought for paper, plastic bags and packaging that have similar color.
After that, I made a 48 by 34 grid and printed in 30 cm wide on paper.
This dimension fits the cardboard from my useless shoes packaging. I cut
the shoebox in appropriate dimension and used pencil to draw the 48 by
34 grid. Each grid is 6 mm wide. I used scissors to cut each material in
this dimension and put them into separate bins. This took me about 1
hour.

The Grid

The next step is gluing 16 hundred pixels on the cardboard
surface. It was an arduous process. Following the progressive scan
method, I applied the pixel from left to right, top to bottom. I
gradually become skilled at this and found that it was quicker to use
scissors as the tweezers to grab the pixel and put them on the board
instead of by hand. This took me about 4 hours. Finally, I used extra
cardboard to build the supporting stand on the back of the frame.

I want this pixel art to enable people to rethink the value of their
trash. It was surprising to me find scraps that have matching colors so
easily. Only using some small pieces of paper or plastic packaging, I
was able to create this pixel art that has great details. All materials
are accessible to everyone, and there are infinite possibilities to
repurpose them, rearrange them, and create arts or useful products.
