## Maymester: Business Japanese
This summer, the "Business Japanese" class provided by University of Southern California (USC) and Kobe University was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me to explore Japanese culture with local people. 

At first the classes have started at USC campus for two weeks and then moved to Japan the latter classes have conducted in Japan for two weeks.

During our time in Kobe, we visited Hanshin Tigers Baseball Club, a sake-brewing company, Elecom, Mizuno, and many other local companies and organizations. Even though we were foreign students who did not speak fluent Japanese, the employees from the companies tried their best to explain the company and its business model to us interestingly and meaningfully. Besides, everyone had a chance to practice business Japanese by greeting and introducing the group to the staff members. We also had chances to exchange business cards in Japanese style. After their presentation, by talking directly to the staff members and USC alumni, we had a basic grasp of the working life in Japan. It was also very valuable to have connections to these companies.

We also had two free days to explore Japan with our personal project. I did a research on animation films in Japan, as I am fond of anime and films in general. Not only was it a first time for me to watch a movie in Japan, but also I had a chance to ask local people's opinion about animation films. We especially had a great time with students and faculty from Kobe University. In the morning, after presenting our case study presentations, we had a delicious lunch and interviewed the students for our individual projects. The students, teachers, and staffs there were incredibly welcoming and patient to our poor Japanese. In the afternoon, we were taken on a tour of the campus and awed at the incredible views and nature surrounding the campus. We finished the day with an amazing buffet dinner where we had the chance to talk more. We're very thankful for having the opportunity to see such a beautiful campus.
