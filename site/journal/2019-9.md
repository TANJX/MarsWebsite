## Material Project
### Fabric - Colorful Socks
2019/9/10

Last Friday, I watched an anime film called Colorful before I started 
this project. I really love the quote from the movie:

> “People don't just have one shade. We have all sorts of different
> colors. 
> 
> And it's fine to have them. 
> 
> Pretty colors... Disgusting colors...”

This is how the protagonist comments on everyone’s life: every character
 in the movie does something wrong but is forgiven eventually. Inspired
by this quote, I want to create a product that is colorful in design and
also has multiple ways to use. After that, I decided to create a pair of
socks that have two sides to reflect the duality of a human’s
personality as shown in the movie.

To get started, I went to the fabric store nearby to purchased fabrics. 
I was planning to make it in pure colors. To make socks, the man in the
fabric store told me that I need some threads that can be stretched so
that it fits on my feet. Unfortunately, the store did not have many
options. Instead, I bought 4 pieces fabrics with interesting patterns.

Back to the workshop, I cut each fabric according the socks I already 
have. To make one two-sided sock, I need four pieces of fabrics. I
created a prototype to prove the idea, but it was too small to fit my
foot.

(The first prototype. This is a sock. It has two sides, each of which also two sides)

When I was going to make an another one, I had a Eureka moment-if I use 
four different pieces of fabrics, it becomes a four-sided sock!
Basically, the four-sided sock is just two socks sewed together.

The whole process took me around 6 to 7 hours. Since I had never used 
sewing machine before, it took me a while to learn how to operate the
machine.

The Colorful Sock is a pair of socks that has multiple facets-just like 
us. We are in different role, mood, and even personality in various
settings throughout the day. First of all, I want the audience and the
users feel cheerful and intrigued since the unique design that is fun to
play and fun to wear. I also want people to embrace an ever-changing,
multifaceted self. This message is a little bit implicit for people
without context, but I would like to tell the story when presenting.

Final Products

### Polymer - Apple's Home (Lego pieces for Apple products)
2019/9/24

I’ve been waiting for this polymer project for a long time. I own plenty
of Apple products¬-Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. I wanted to have
a watch and phone charging stand, but I did not like the design online.
This project is the opportunity to create my own design.

I started with pencil sketch and designed a few iterations. Then I moved
to modeling on computer. Alex suggested me to use OnShape, an online
CAD, to create models for 3D printing. It was my first time using CAD to
create 3D models, and I enjoyed the process of building objects based on
measurement and constraints.

I created three models: two for Apple Watch, one for iPhone. I put
standardized cross-shaped protruding on the bottom so that the models
are modular and removable. They can be arranged based on needs and
preference.

However, I realized that it will be hard to create an acrylic base that
has precise slots to insert my models. Suddenly, the Lego pad came cross
my head. I can add the Lego pattern on the bottom surface so the models
would be able to simply put on Lego boards.

I tried to print some prototypes using regular FDM 3d printers. The
quality was not so good as expected: it is light, coarse, and cheap
looking. After tweaking the diameter of the Apple Watch charger, I
printed my model again using the advanced SLA printer. The material,
photosensitive resin, is translucent, heavier, and smooth after using
hand files.
